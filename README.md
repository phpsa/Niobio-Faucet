# Photon-Faucet

This is a PHP and MYSQL Faucet for Photon

I developed this for free to help spread the world about Photon but if you want to tip me, everything will be appreciated :D

It is setup to be a fair winning based on a random generation plus a bonus seed:

IE: a random number between 1 and 10000 is generated and based on that:

* if the number is 10000 - max winnings is paid out.
* if the number is 9998/9999 then 10% of max winning + up to bonus is paid out
* 9994 - 9997 - 1% if max plus bonus
* 9986 - 9993 - 0.1% of max plus bonus
* the balance will get the min payout + bonus

Script is not tied to any microwallet or wallet and can be used on any shared hosting platform as payments currently are manual - will be looking at ways to automate this without having to tie into any fancy hosting requirements.
